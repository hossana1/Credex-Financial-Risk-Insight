## 📌 Insights & Recommendations
# 1. Prioritize Low-Risk Clients
Low-risk clients receive the largest share of loans—continue incentivizing this segment to reduce default risk.

# 2. Review Mid Credit Score Group
Score category 3 shows the highest default volume—requires a policy or credit model review.

# 3. Target Employment-Based Segments
Employment status doesn’t majorly affect loan volume. Use behavioral profiling to refine eligibility.

# 4. Optimize Country-Level Targeting
Countries like Congo and Korea are high performers—consider deeper market penetration strategies.

# 5. Gender-Based Financial Inclusion
Balanced loan distribution suggests an inclusive approach. Continue monitoring gender-specific repayment patterns for proactive support.
